## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The Anaconda distribution of Python should contain all of the necessary packages to successfully run this code.
## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
In this project I was interested in three questions using a subset of the Titanic's passenger list as a data set:

  1 - Does the addage of 'Women and children first' hold true?
  
  2 - Who were the passengers on the Titanic and what titles did they hold?
  
  3 - Can we predict who survived and who didn't using the other features in the dataset?
## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is one notebook. This notebook contains all of the data wrangling, exploration and model building used to answer the 3 questions posed above. Markdown cells are used to explain the steps being taken at each stage. The dataset used is train.csv, containing details for 891 passengers.
## Results <a name="results"></a>
The findings of the code can be found here: https://medium.com/@matthew.riddiford/would-you-have-survived-on-the-titanic-fa2b858b63be

The dataset used comes from Kaggle - more information can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview. Feel free to use this code as you wish.
